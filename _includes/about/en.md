Hi, I’m Zhuojun Li, currently a third-year PhD student in the
[Human-Computer Interaction and Pervasive Computing Lab](https://pi.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn),
Department of Computer Science, Tsinghua University.

My research focuses on human motion sensing and interaction technologies in HCI.
I work with sensors such as IMUs and cameras to capture human movement and recognize interactive actions,
with the goal of building convenient and effective interaction interfaces.
So far, my work has mainly covered text input, human motion capture, and hand tracking.
Looking ahead, my research will focus on leveraging IMUs and multimodal sensing
to support richer interactions in mobile and spatial computing.

Outside of research, my main interests are skiing and photography.
I’ve been skiing on alpine skis for 17 years,
usually commuting between Beijing and Chongli in winter.
I started photography three years ago as a Sony user,
mainly capturing landscapes, night skies, and everyday life.
