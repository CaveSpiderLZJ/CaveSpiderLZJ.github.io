Hi, I am Zhuojun Li (CaveSpider), a senior undergraduate in the [Department of Computer Science and Technology](https://www.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/csen/)., [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/). Currently, I am researching in the [Pervasive Human-Computer Interaction Lab](https://pi.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn), advised by [Prof. Chun Yu](https://pi.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/lab/people/ChunYu/).

I have a keen interest in computer science. I am most familiar with [Python](https://www.python.org) and [C++](https://cplusplus.com), and also have working experience with [Java](https://www.java.com/en/), [C#](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/), [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org), [Matlab](https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html), etc. My routine work mainly includes human-computer interaction and sensing related research and data analysis. Aside from my research, my main interest is skiing, which I have kept doing for more than 12 years. I have much more hobbies as well, like [TRPGs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tabletop_role-playing_game), music, photography, basketball, swimming, diving, etc., but few of them I could stick with for long. Since 2020, I have become a [bilibili](https://www.bilibili.com) [uploader](https://space.bilibili.com/15293779). And I would irregularly post videos following my heart. Please subscribe to my channel if you like it.
